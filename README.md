# 🤖 Day 1 – What is Generative AI? (Chatbot using GPT-4)

Welcome to Day 1 of my **#100DaysOfAI** challenge!  
Today, I dove into the fundamentals of **Generative AI** and built a simple terminal-based chatbot using **OpenAI's GPT-4 API**.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

| Tool         | Purpose                                      |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Python       | Main programming language                    |
| OpenAI API   | To access GPT-4 for text generation          |
| VS Code      | Code editor for writing the script           |

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. The script sends your input prompt to the GPT-4 model using OpenAI's Chat API.
2. GPT-4 processes it and returns a relevant, human-like response.
3. The loop continues until the user types `"exit"`.
